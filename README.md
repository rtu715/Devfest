Why we are creating this app:
We want to make it easier to access and display useful information in a centralized location and allow users to customize the flow of data they see to their personal tastes. An similar existing tool exists for Linux users as Conky, but the the application is not very user friendly and accessible for most computer users and and also not very aesthetic.
